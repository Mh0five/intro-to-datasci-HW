It helps investors compare stock prices with previous prices to determine market performance.\n\nIn this project you are provided with two CSV files containing Nasdaq-100 stock information:\n- _**nasdaq100_CA.csv**_: contains information about companies in the index such as symbol, name, etc. For this analysis, only companies headquartered in California have been selected.\n- _**nasdaq100_price_change.csv**_: contains price changes per stock across periods including (but not limited to) one day, five days, one month, six months, one year, etc.\n\nAs an AI developer, you will leverage the OpenAI API to classify companies into sectors and produce a summary of sector and company performance for this year, for the companies in the index that are headquartered in California.","metadata":{},"id":"c36c709e-8395-48d2-8a18-918cd2df89a9","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# CSV with Nasdaq-100 stock data\n\nIn this project, you have available two CSV files

The sector benefits from ongoing advancements in AI and cloud computing.\n\n2. **Consumer Discretionary**\n   - Notable Companies: AMZN, TSLA\n   - Average YTD Performance: Approximately 66.2%\n   - Key Highlights: TSLA shows a remarkable 132.61% YTD return, and AMZN contributes positively as well. The sector is buoyed by strong consumer spending and recovery post-pandemic.\n\n3. **Miscellaneous**\n   - Average YTD Performance: Approximately 20.5%\n   - Key Highlights: This sector includes a mix of companies with varying performances. While some companies like META and MRVL show significant gains, others are underperforming.\n\n### Best Sectors\n\n1. **Consumer Discretionary**\n   - **Rationale**: Strong performance driven by leading companies like TSLA and AMZN, indicating robust consumer demand and spending. The sector's resilience in a recovering economy presents a favorable risk-to-reward ratio, especially with high-growth potential.\n\n2. **Technology**\n   - **Rationale**: The sector's average YTD performance is bolstered by major players like NVDA and AAPL, with significant growth prospects in AI and tech innovation. While it carries risks related to market volatility, the potential for high returns makes it attractive.\n\n### Risk to Reward Evaluation\n\n- **Consumer Discretionary**: The sector's strong performance suggests a favorable risk-to-reward ratio, particularly if consumer spending continues to rise. However, it is sensitive to economic downturns and inflation, which could impact discretionary spending.\n\n- **Technology**: While the sector shows high returns, it is also subject to market fluctuations and regulatory scrutiny. The rapid pace of innovation can lead to volatility, but the potential for substantial long-term growth offsets this risk.\n\nIn conclusion, both sectors present strong growth potential with varying degrees of risk, making them appealing for investors seeking exposure to high-performing segments of the market.\n"}],"execution_count":65}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
